/*
 * Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You
 * may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
 * 
 * Example 1: Input:
 * 
 * "bbbab" Output: 4 One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
 * Example 2: Input:
 * 
 * "cbbd" Output: 2 One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
