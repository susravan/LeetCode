/* Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array),
 * print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the
 * first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search
 * circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
